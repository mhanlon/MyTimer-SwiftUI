# MyTimer-SwiftUI

This is an example of using a ViewModel and a Model to implement a timer that will count up when you hit the Start button.

It also shows us capturing some @State for the user interface to change the label (and function) of the Start/Stop button, depending whether or not we've started a timer.

Lastly, it shows off the application of custom fonts to both `Text` and SF Symbol `Image`s, as well as the use of the background view modifier with a Shape (`Capsule`) to highlight our main UI target.
